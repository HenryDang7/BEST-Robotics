 /*
  * This file should define the "autonomous()" function.
  * The "autonomous()" function defines what the robot should do when the autonomous period is enabled.
  *
  * Important Information:
  * The function must not loop infinitely or else no other task may be ran.
  * Code within the function cannot access information from the VEX Joystick (Controller) unless it is called during the operational period.
  *
  * Note: When the robot is disconnected and then reconnected—by either turning
  * it off and on or through the loss of communications—the function will be recalled,
  * meaning it does not resume where it left off.
